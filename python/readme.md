## Python

Python is one of the most widely adopted programming languages being one of the most interesting and the third most popular language. It is an interpreted language, which means that it can execute instructions directly and freely, without compiling the code previously into low-level machine instructions. Being a general-purpouse language, it means it can be used in a wide variety of application domains.

### Instalation

Most Linux Distributions come with Python pre-installed. To confirm this you can write `python3` in terminal and check if a prompt gets launched. If not, you can install it doing `sudo apt install python3` on Debian based distributions.  
\
It is also recommended to use a code editor such as Visual Studio Code to use functionalities built into it like Auto-complete and debugging.

### Use

To make a Python file, just make a new file with the extension `.py`. Open it and start programming. To run the code you can type in the terminal `python nameoffile.py`.

### Variables and Data Structures

As in many programming languages, there are many types of ways of organizing data. There are 2 types of data structures:  

* Linear data structures (Organized linearly, one after another, only one item can be acessed at a time):
    * Array
    * Linked list
    * Queue
    * Stack  
* Non-linear data structures (Not organized in sequential order, but are connected to several other data items to represent relationships):
    * Tree
    * Heap
    * Hash Table
    * Graph
