### Version Control Systems

A version control system (VCS) is a software tool used to track and manage changes to a filesystem, often used in collaborative work.  
Nowadays, one of the most used VCS is Git, used via remote repositories like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.

#### Git Characteristics

- On the same project every repository has the same data (if up-to-date)
- Faster than other VCS
- Space used is minimized on local and push/pull data transfers
- Simple, large userbase and excelent tools
