## Weka

Weka (which stands for Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) is a software package that contains a collection of tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modelling.

### Introduction

This document aims at introducing the "supervised machine learning" paradigm building on the Weka machine learning framework and some application examples that illustrate its main functionality.

### Instalation

In Linux, download the software .zip file and extract it, and then run `./weka.sh` in the extracted directory.

### Usage

The graphical user interface is divided in different menus:
* Explorer is used to explore datasets, ML algorithms and analyze results
* Experimenter is used to design experiments for performance and comparison evaluations
* KnowledgeFlow is an advanced Explorer application to graphically design ML pipelines
* Workbench conbines the functionality of the explorer and the experimenter into a single GUI
* Simple GUI is a command-line interface to access ML algorithms.
