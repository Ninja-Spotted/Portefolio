## Node.js

The goal of this document is to introduce the use of Node.js in web development, have a first insight of Node.js, understand its working principles, identify its advantages/limitations, have a perception of different use-cases, and be able to develop basic applications based on this programming technology.

### Introduction

There are many frameworks useid in web and backend development, each relevant in certain applications. The main competing tecnologies are:
* Django (FOSS high level pyhon web framework, with lots of documentation and fast app development)
* ASP.NET (Backend from Microsoft, despite being FOSS it is only available for the Windows OS, there is a new approach called ASP.NET Core that is compatible with Linux and macOS)
* Node.js (It's a server side, FOSS javascript runtime environment that enables fast and scalable development of web applications)

\
Node.js is not well suited for CPU intensive applications since the non-blocking processing would be always returning, but it is effective in distributed applications such as I/O bound, Data streaming, etc.  
It is a low-level platform with a standard library with excelent support for networking.  
\
In this document, we will use the Express library, which has become very popular for Node.js development, and Bootstrap for the web app frontend.
