## game-development
I am currently interested in low spec game engines like [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html), [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), and [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

## programming-languages
I mainly learned [C](https://www.learn-c.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), and recently started with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
